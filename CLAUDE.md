## Orchestrator Retrospectives

When using the orchestrator agent, always include the full Phase 6 Retrospective in your response to the user, unedited and unabridged. Do not summarize, truncate, or omit any section. The retrospective is the most important output of the orchestration process and must always be visible to the user.

After showing the retrospective, also tell the user the file path where it was saved (the orchestrator writes retrospectives to `.claude/retrospectives/`).
